# django-wakawaka

django-wakawaka is a super simple wiki system written in Python using the
Django framework.

- Links between Wiki pages are automatically resolved by their CamelCase naming
  scheme.

- It automatically keeps track of revision changes of a Page, while
  providing the ability to revert to earlier states.

- It also has a quite comprehensive permission integration, taking care of
  Django's default create/edit/delete permissions.

- Wakawaka is an application and indented to be placed in an existing project.

## Installation:

1. Put `wakawaka` to your INSTALLED_APPS in your settings.py within your
   django project.
2. Add `(r'^wiki/', include('wakawaka.urls')),` to your urls.py.

That's all. Wakawaka has no other dependencies than Django 1.11 or later.

## Configuration:

Wakawaka takes care of Django's permission system. Grant your users always a
pair of `wikipage` and `revision` permissions either what they should do.
(Adding, changing or deleting WikiPages)

### Optional Settings:

The name of your first wiki page is defined as `WikiIndex`. You can change
this by adding a setting `WAKAWAKA_DEFAULT_INDEX` to your settings.py.
Example:

    WAKAWAKA_DEFAULT_INDEX = 'Home'

Words that are written in CamelCase (a pair of one upper letter followed by
_n_ lower letters) are automatically treated as internal wiki links. You can
change this behaviour by adding a setting `WAKAWAKA_SLUG_REGEX` to your
settings.py. This holds a regular expression of the wiki name format. Default:

    WAKAWAKA_SLUG_REGEX = r'((([A-Z]+[a-z]+){2,})(/([A-Z]+[a-z]+){2,})*)'

### Attachments:

Wakawaka does not provide the ability to store file attachments to wiki pages.
To do so, have a look on the side project [django-attachments][django-attachments]
which provides a unobstrusive way to add attachments to models.

## Testing and Development:

The project comes with a test library which can be simply invoked by Tox,
which tests the project under all current Python and Django versions:

    $ pip install tox
    $ tox

To run the testsuite manually in your development environment, install the
project using [Poetry][poetry]:

    $ poetry install
    $ pipenv run pytest

## Example Project:

The application comes with a sample project. This gives you a brief overview
about the Wiki features, and can help you with the integration of the
application into an existing project. It's alo used for the test suite:

    $ poetry install
    $ poetry run ./manage.py migrate
    $ poetry run ./manage.py createsuperuser
    $ poetry run ./manage.py runserver
